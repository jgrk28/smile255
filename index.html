          Smile255 is the first and only Tanzanian youth ultimate frisbee program. Started in 2015 by Mwinyi Fantastic, the program has sent youth players to tournaments in Rwanda, Kenya, and Uganda. The mission of Smile255 is to grow the sport of ultimate frisbee in Tanzania through empowering and enspiring young players. Mwinyi believes that it is important to create a welcoming environment for ultimate frisbee in Tanzania where everyone can have an equal opportunity to join. Smile255 places special emphasis on Spirit of the Game and equity in an attempt to grow the sport in the healthiest way possible. <br><br>
          In addition to sending players to tournaments in nearby countries, Mwinyi and Smile255 have also organized all of the tournaments in Tanzania in recent years. The Kilimanjaro International Frisbee Tournament, in 2019, hosted players from Tanzania, Rwanda, Kenya, and the USA. The Swahili International Beach Club Tournament, planned for 2022, will be hosted in Mwanza in an attempt to bring more international players and inspire the players of Tanzania.
